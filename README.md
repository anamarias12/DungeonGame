# Dungeon Game

## Description
Dungeon Game is a text-based adventure game implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Players navigate a dynamic grid-based world, encountering enemies and advancing their characters by gaining experience points.

## Features
- **Grid-based Exploration:** The game world is represented as an `n x m` matrix, where each cell may contain enemies, sanctuaries, portals, or be empty.
- **Character System:** Players can choose from multiple characters, each with unique attributes and abilities.
- **Combat Mechanics:** Battles against enemies involve strategic use of basic attacks and special abilities.
- **Leveling System:** Characters gain experience and level up, enhancing their attributes over time.
- **Resource Management:** Players manage health and mana, which can be restored through sanctuaries.
- **Procedural Map Generation:** Each new game session generates a different map layout.

## Gameplay
